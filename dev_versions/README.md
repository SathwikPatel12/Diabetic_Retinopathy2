# Archived App Versions

This folder contains earlier versions of the Diabetic Retinopathy Streamlit App, stored for reference.

## ðŸ“„ Version Summary

### app_v1_basic.py
- Basic app structure
- No animations or custom styles

### app_v2_with_changes.py
- Added dropdown-based Lottie animations
- Introduced custom CSS styling
- And this app version_2 is there in the project1.ipynb file, and it is generated as app.py in that google colab, so don't change that in colab.

These are not deployed â€” only `app.py` in the root folder is active on Streamlit Cloud.
